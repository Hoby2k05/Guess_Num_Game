# Practice_Code_1

 This project is about a quick number guessing game with your system.
Where the system chooses a nmber at random and you get some attempts
based on your chosen difficulty level, to guess it.
You score points on the bases of how far or close you are to the chosen number.
There are hints along the way as well, helping you guess the correct numebr quickly....
A leaderboard system if you choose with your friends one by one ....

 Any suggestions and required improvements would be appriciated..
Thank you....
#....HAVE FUN....#
